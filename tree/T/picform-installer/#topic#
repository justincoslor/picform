We want to develop an installer that installs PICForm on a new
computer.

Install PICForm on someone's computer.
Install PICForm on a Vagrant VM.
Install PICForm Hosting Platform on a Vagrant VM.

((Develop the <PROJECTNAME> Vagrant Bootstrap VagrantFile which is
 hosted in a git repository, which, given a system with Vagrant
 already correctly installed, creates a virtual machine using vagrant
 which has vagrant all setup, i.e. it installs the packages for
 vagrant etc.  Give this machine a temporary working hostname of
 vagrant.<PROJECTNAME>.org)

 (Then develop the <PROJECTNAME> Hosting Platform Vagrantfile, which
  runs on vagrant.<PROJECTNAME>.org which creates several new VMs
  representing the entire <PROJECTNAME> hos ting platform,
  i.e. machines like the git repository, the webserver, etc.  All of
  that (even if for starters that's just one VM called say
  hosting.<PROJECTNAME>.org))

 (Then develop the <PROJECTNAME> Installer Vagrantfile, which
  runs on the hosting.<PROJECTNAME>.org (cluster) and sets up a new
  installation of <PROJECTNAME> for end users to use)

 (From the <PROJECTNAME> Installer Vagrantfile, develop an
  installer which does not require vagrant which installs
  <PROJECTNAME> on a virgin computer)
 )
