PicForm

seed AI (plant words in a setting to grow like plants in a garden)

code repositories that anyone can use and download but not edit, how do you want them to be inserted into this: Topic:Priority:Goal:Context:Pattern:Variable:Dimension

each project will need a tree (by tree epistemology)

HoHoHoH each hash is a class for object oriented programming

Have a thing that allows you to descend the tree of topics, via TEXT, nice to have a GUI eventually:

# where does the installer go, it is going to be a vagrant script if that's okay which fully installs/uninstalls picform on a computer

Make a man page for PicForm based on the jpg image J sent.

(develop installer)
(develop tests)

Move the picform image where it is supposed to go.

(Make a xsd or dtd for a picform xml format, try rtf and owl as well)

(Convert java classes to picform epistemology)
